## 2026-01-03: Split complex parsing and error tests
- Problem: parser/parse_complex_errors_test.mbt mixed a complex filter parse snapshot with error cases.
- Change: Split into parser/parse_complex_filter_test.mbt and parser/parse_error_cases_test.mbt.
- Result: Complex parse and error cases are separated without behavior changes.
- Example:
Before: parser/parse_complex_errors_test.mbt held both complex filter and error snapshots.
After: complex filter lives in parser/parse_complex_filter_test.mbt; error cases live in parser/parse_error_cases_test.mbt.

## 2026-01-03: Split lexing complex tests by theme
- Problem: parser/lex_complex_test.mbt mixed comment/whitespace, pipelines, constructs, control flow, and bindings.
- Change: Split into parser/lex_comment_whitespace_test.mbt, parser/lex_pipeline_test.mbt, parser/lex_constructs_test.mbt, parser/lex_control_flow_test.mbt, and parser/lex_binding_test.mbt.
- Result: Lexing tests are grouped by concern with no behavior changes.
- Example:
Before: parser/lex_complex_test.mbt contained all complex lexing snapshots.
After: each lexing topic lives in its own test file.

## 2026-01-03: Split advanced builtin coverage tests
- Problem: ast/coverage_advanced_builtins_test.mbt mixed comparisons, membership, collection ops, string helpers, math, and base64 coverage.
- Change: Split into focused coverage files by feature.
- Result: Coverage cases are grouped by concern with no behavior change.
- Example:
Before: ast/coverage_advanced_builtins_test.mbt contained all advanced builtin coverage tests together.
After: coverage_comparisons_test.mbt, coverage_membership_test.mbt, coverage_update_path_test.mbt, coverage_collection_ops_test.mbt, coverage_arithmetic_mixed_test.mbt, coverage_string_helpers_test.mbt, coverage_math_test.mbt, and coverage_base64_test.mbt separate the cases.
